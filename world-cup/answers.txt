Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
As you increase the number of simulations, the predictions should converge to more stable values.
With a small number of simulations, you might observe more variance in the predictions.
By increasing the number of simulations, you are effectively reducing the impact of randomness and obtaining more reliable estimates.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
