Audio Aura Characterization:
The term "audio aura" could be defined as a listener's unique musical taste or preferences, characterized by the audio features of the songs they listen to. Based on the top 100 songs from the 'songs.db' database, I would characterize the listener's audio aura by analyzing several audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, tempo, and speechiness.

1. Danceability: If the average danceability score is high, the listener might prefer songs with a beat or rhythm suitable for dancing. This could indicate a preference for pop, electronic, or dance music.
2. Energy: A higher average energy score might suggest that the listener prefers more intense and active music, possibly including rock or hip-hop.
3. Valence: If the average valence score is high, it suggests that the listener tends to prefer more positive and happier music. A low valence score might indicate a preference for more somber or melancholic tracks.
4. Tempo: A higher average tempo might indicate a preference for faster-paced music, while a lower tempo might suggest a preference for slower, more relaxed music.
5. Speechiness: A higher speechiness score could indicate that the listener has a preference for tracks with more spoken words, such as rap or spoken word.

Limitations:

However, characterizing audio aura solely based on the top 100 songs from a single year might not be representative for several reasons:

1. Temporal Preferences: Musical tastes can evolve over time. The listener's preferences in 2018 might have changed since then.
2. Mood Variations: The listener might have gone through different moods or life events in 2018 that temporarily affected their song choices.
3. Limited Sample: 100 songs is a relatively small sample size to characterize a person's broad music taste.

Proposed Alternatives:

1. Time Frame Expansion: Analyze the listener's song choices over a more extended period to account for changes in taste and preferences.
2. Playlist Analysis: Analyze the different playlists created by the listener to understand the variety of genres and moods they enjoy.
3. Incorporate Metadata: Use metadata like genres, sub-genres, and artist influences to give more depth to the audio aura.
4. User Feedback: Incorporate explicit feedback from the listener, such as song ratings or ‘liked’ tracks.

By using a combination of these approaches, we can create a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the listener’s audio aura.
